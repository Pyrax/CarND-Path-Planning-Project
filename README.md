# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Goals

In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

## Writeup

### Rubric points

The program fulfills the following specifications:
- The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.
- The car drives according to the speed limit.
- Max acceleration (10m/s^2) and jerk (10m/s^3) are not exceeded.
- The car does not have collisions.
- The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
- The car is able to change lanes.

### Model Documentation

Path generation is split into three different parts:
1. First, a behavior planner (`BehaviorPlanner.h`) determines which trajectory the vehicle should take next. Therefore, it considers the current positions and velocities of the ego car and all other cars. From this information it chooses the next desired state. 
2. Then, a trajectory is generated using jerk minimizing trajectories which fits to the desired state (`TrajectoryGenerator.h`).
3. In the end, a motion planner calculates the real coordinates from the generated trajectories transforming vehicle states into an actual path (`MotionPlanner.h`).

#### Behavior Planner
The Behavior Planner decides which target trajectory and state should be taken. Currently, it only considers the positions and velocities of other vehicles and the ego car. So, a simple deterministic approach is taken where 3 states are available which include `STATE_KEEP_LANE`, `STATE_CHANGE_LANE_LEFT` and `STATE_CHANGE_LANE_RIGHT`. The Behavior Planner is also responsible for realizing safe lane changes without collisions.
Ideally, it could also incorporate predictions of other vehicles trajectories and use cost functions to find the most suitable trajectory. However, due to time constraints I sticked to the simple approach which is sufficient for the given task.
Also, the current Behavior Planner only changes one lane at a time. This means going from far left to the far right consists of multiple single lane changes. This could be optimized to support multiple lane changes through a single trajectory.

#### Trajectory generator
Different trajectories are generated for different desired behaviors. The Trajectory Generator translates the current and the target state of a vehicle into a polynomial function which can be solved for time to get a set of points. It uses jerk minimized trajectories to describe the path and to take limits into account. Therefore, it follows the constraints of maximum speed, acceleration and jerk.

#### Motion planner
Transitioning the generated trajectories into an actual path is realized through the motion planner. It takes the polynomial functions and solves them for a given time T to get the frenet coordinates. These frenet values are then converted to cartesian coordinates which can be used by the simulator. In order to create smooth paths, the conversion into XY-coordinates is realized through spline interpolation with a [cubic spline interpolation library](https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/).

## Project instructions

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)
